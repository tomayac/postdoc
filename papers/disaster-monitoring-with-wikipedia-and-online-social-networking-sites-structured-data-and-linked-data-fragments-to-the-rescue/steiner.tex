\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Disaster Monitoring: A~Global Challenge}
\label{sec:natural-disaster-detection}

According to a~study~\cite{laframboise2012naturaldisasters}
published by the International Monetary Funds (IMF) in 2012,
about 700~natural disasters were registered worldwide between 2010 and 2012,
affecting more than 450~million people.
According to the study, ``[d]amages have risen
from an estimated US\$20 billion on average per year
in the 1990s to about US\$100 billion per year during 2000--10.''
The authors expect this upward trend to continue
``as a~result of the rising concentration of people
living in areas more exposed to natural disasters,
and climate change.''
In consequence, public emergency alerting systems
become more and more crucial in the future.

National agencies like the
\emph{Federal Emergency Management Agency}
(FEMA)\footnote{FEMA: \url{http://www.fema.gov/}}
in the United States of America or the
\emph{Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}
(BBK,\footnote{BBK: \url{http://www.bbk.bund.de/}}
``Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance'')
in Germany work to ensure the safety of the population
on a~national level, combining and providing relevant tasks
and information in a~single place.
The \emph{United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs}
(OCHA)\footnote{OCHA: \url{http://www.unocha.org/}}
is a~United Nations (UN) body formed to strengthen the UN's response
to complex emergencies and natural disasters.
The \emph{Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System}
(GDACS)\footnote{GDACS: \url{http://www.gdacs.org/}}
is ``a~cooperation framework between the United Nations,
the European Commission, and disaster managers worldwide
to improve alerts, information exchange, and coordination
in the first phase after major sudden-onset disasters.''
Global companies like Facebook,%
\footnote{Facebook Disaster Relief:
\url{https://www.facebook.com/DisasterRelief}}
Airbnb,\footnote{Airbnb Disaster Response:
\url{https://www.airbnb.com/disaster-response}} or
Google\footnote{Google Crisis Response:
\url{https://www.google.org/crisisresponse/}}
have dedicated crisis response teams that work on
making critical emergency information accessible in times of disaster.
As can be seen from the (incomprehensive) list above,
natural disaster detection and response is a~problem
tackled on national, international, and global levels;
both from the public and private sectors.

\subsection{Hypotheses and Research Questions}

In this paper, we present first results of
our ongoing early-stage research
on a~realtime comprehensive Wikipedia-based monitoring system
for the detection of natural disasters around the globe.
This system is language-agnostic and leverages
multimedia content shared on online social networking sites,
striving to help disaster responders prioritize their efforts.
Structured data about detected disasters is made available
in form of Linked Data to facilitate its consumption.
Both authors primarily come from the Semantic Web
and Linked Data communities
and have limited prior experience in disaster response.
We are steered by the following hypotheses.

\begin{description}
  \itemsep0em
  \item[$\mathbb{H}1$] Content about natural disasters
    gets added to Wikipedia and online social networking sites in a~timely fashion.
  \item[$\mathbb{H}2$] Natural disasters being geographically
    constrained, textual and multimedia content about them
    gets added to local, \emph{i.e.}, non-English Wikipedias
    and online social networking sites
    in the particular local languages.
  \item[$\mathbb{H}3$] Link structure dynamics of Wikipedia
    provide for a~meaningful way to detect future
    natural disasters, \emph{i.e.}, disasters unknown at system creation time.
\end{description}

\noindent These hypotheses lead us to the following research questions.

\begin{description}
  \itemsep0em
  \item[$\mathbb{Q}1$] How timely and accurate for the purpose
    of natural disaster detection is content from Wikipedia
    and online social networking sites
    compared to content from authoritative sources mentioned above?
  \item[$\mathbb{Q}2$] Does the disambiguated nature of Wikipedia
    (things, not strings) surpass keyword-based natural disaster detection approaches,
    \emph{e.g.}, via online social network sites or search logs?
  \item[$\mathbb{Q}3$] How much noise gets added by doing full-text searches
    (strings, not things) for multimedia content on online social networking sites? 
\end{description}

\section{Background and Enabling Technologies}

\subsection{The \emph{Common Alerting Protocol}}
To facilitate collaboration, a~common protocol is essential.
The \emph{Common Alerting Protocol} (CAP)~\cite{westfall2010cap}
is an XML-based general data format for exchanging public warnings
and emergencies between alerting technologies.
CAP allows a~warning message to be consistently disseminated simultaneously
over many warning systems to many applications.
The protocol increases warning effectiveness and
simplifies the task of activating a~warning for officials.
CAP also provides the capability to include multimedia data,
such as photos, maps, or videos.
Alerts can be geographically targeted to a~defined warning area.
An exemplary flood warning CAP feed stemming from GDACS is shown in
Listing~\ref{listing:cap}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={\emph{Common Alerting Protocol} feed

\subsection{Linked Data and Linked Data Principles}

Linked Data~\cite{bernerslee2006linkeddata}
defines a~set of agreed-on best practices and
principles for interconnecting and publishing
structured data on the Web.
It uses Web technologies like the Hypertext Transfer Protocol~(HTTP,~\cite{fielding1999http})
and Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs,~\cite{bernerslee2005uri})
to create typed links between different sources.
The portal \url{http://linkeddata.org/} (accessed October 27, 2014)
defines Linked Data as being
\textit{``about using the Web to connect related data that
wasn't previously linked, or using the Web
to lower the barriers to linking data
currently linked using other methods.''}

Tim Berners-Lee defined the four rules for Linked Data in a~W3C Design Issue~\cite{bernerslee2006linkeddata}
published in 2006 as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use URIs as names for things.
  \item Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
  \item When someone looks up a~URI, provide useful information,
        using the standards (RDF, SPARQL).
  \item Include links to other URIs,
        so that they can discover more things.
\end{enumerate}

Linked Data uses RDF~\cite{klyne2004rdf} to create
typed links between things in the world.
The result is oftentimes referred to as the \emph{Web of Data}.
RDF encodes statements about things in the form of
\texttt{(subject, predicate, object)} triples.
If subject and object have URIs from different namespaces,
Bizer \emph{et~al.}\ speak of \emph{RDF links}
in~\cite{heath2011linkeddata}.

\subsection{Linked Data Fragments}

The most straightforward way to access Linked Data
is to dereference the URL of a~Linked Data document
to retrieve a~representation of the resource identified by that URL.
An alternative interface is a~data dump,
which is a~typically large file that contains all triples from a certain dataset.
Both approaches have their specific disadvantages regarding scalability and currency.
SPARQL endpoints offer an interface that allows to select data much more granularly.
This is more convenient for clients, but individual requests
are considerably more expensive for servers.
The goal of Linked Data Fragments is to provide a~uniform view
on all possible interfaces to Linked Data.
A~Linked Data Fragment of a~Linked Data dataset is a~set of RDF triples
that consists of three parts~\cite{verborgh2014ldf,verborgh2014ldfiswc}.

\begin{description}
  \item[Data] all triples of this dataset that match a specific selector;
  \item[Metadata] triples that describe the dataset and/or the Linked Data Fragment;
  \item[Controls] hypermedia links and/or forms that lead to other Linked Data Fragments.
\end{description}

Linked Data Fragments offer an alternative
to SPARQL for publishing queryable Linked Data.
Specifically, Triple Pattern Fragments
(also known as basic Linked Data Fragments),
a~type of Linked Data Fragments, enable users to host Linked Data
on low-cost servers with higher availability
than SPARQL endpoints~\cite{DBLP:conf/semweb/MatteisV14}.

\section{Related Work}

Digitally crowdsourced data for disaster detection and response
has gained momentum in recent years,
as the Internet has proven resilient in times of crises,
compared to other infrastructure.
Ryan Falor, Crisis Response Product Manager at Google in 2011,
remarks in~\cite{falor2011googleorg} that
``a~substantial \textup{[\,\dots]} proportion of searches
are directly related to the crises;
and people continue to search and access information online
even while traffic and search levels drop temporarily
during and immediately following the crises.''
In the following, we provide a~non-exhaustive list of related work
on digitally crowdsourced natural disaster detection and response.
Sakaki \emph{et~al.}\ consider in~\cite{sakaki2010earthquake} each user
of the online social networking (OSN) site
Twitter\footnote{Twitter: \url{https://twitter.com/}} a~sensor
for the purpose of earthquake detection in Japan.
% They devise a~classifier of tweets based on features such as
% keywords, number of words, and their context;
% and produce a~probabilistic spatiotemporal model that
% can find the center and the trajectory of the earthquake.
Goodchild \emph{et~al.}\ show in~\cite{goodchild2010crowdsourcing}
how crowdsourced geodata from Wikipedia and
Wikimapia,\footnote{Wikimapia: \url{http://wikimapia.org/}}
``a~multilingual open-content collaborative map,''
can help complete authoritative data about natural disasters.
In~\cite{abel2012twitcident}, Abel \emph{et~al.}\ describe
a~crisis monitoring system that extracts relevant content
about known disasters from Twitter.
Liu \emph{et~al.}\ examine in~\cite{liu2008search}
common patterns and norms of natural disaster coverage
on the photo sharing site Flickr.%
\footnote{Flickr: \url{https://www.flickr.com/}}
We have developed~\cite{steiner2014thesis} a~ monitoring system
that detects news events from concurrent Wikipedia edits
and auto-generates related multimedia galleries
based on content from various OSN sites
and Wikimedia Commons.\footnote{Wikimedia Commons: \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/}}
Finally, Lin and Mishne examine realtime search query churn on Twitter%
~\cite{lin2012churn} including in the context of natural disasters.

\section{Proposed Methodology}

\subsection{Leveraging Wikipedia Link Structure}

Wikipedia is an international online encyclopedia
currently available in 287~languages.%
\footnote{All Wikipedias: \url{http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias}}
\emph{(i)}~Articles in one language are interlinked with versions of the same article
in other languages, \emph{e.g.}, the article ``Natural disaster''
on the English Wikipedia
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster}) \linebreak
links to 74~versions of this article in other languages.%
\footnote{Article language links:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=langlinks&lllimit=max&titles=Natural_disaster}}
\emph{(ii)}~Each article can have redirects, \emph{i.e.}, alternative URLs
that point to the article.
For the English ``Natural disaster'' article, there are eight redirects,%
\footnote{Article redirects:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=backlinks&blfilterredir=redirects&bllimit=max&bltitle=Natural_disaster}}
\emph{e.g.}, ``Natural Hazard'' (synonym),
``Examples of natural disaster'' (refinement), or
``Natural disasters'' (plural).
\emph{(iii)}~For each article, the list of back links
that link to the current article is available, \emph{i.e.},
inbound links other than redirects.
The article ``Natural disaster'' has more than 500 articles that link to it.%
\footnote{Article inbound links: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=backlinks&bllimit=max&blnamespace=0&bltitle=Natural_disaster}}
Likewise, the list of outbound links, \emph{i.e.}, other articles
that the current article links to, is available.%
\footnote{Article outbound links: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=links&plnamespace=0&format=json&pllimit=max&titles=Natural_disaster}}
By combining an article's in- and outbound links,
we determine the set of mutual links,
\emph{i.e.}, the set of articles that the current article links to (outbound links)
and at the same time receives links from (inbound links).

\subsection{Identification of Wikipedia Articles for Monitoring}
\label{sec:identification-of-monitoring}

Starting with the well-curated English seed article ``Natural disaster'',
we programmatically follow each of the therein contained links of type ``Main article:'',
which leads to an exhaustive list of English articles
of concrete types of natural disasters,
\emph{e.g.}, ``Tsunami'' (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami}),
``Flood'' (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood}),
``Earthquake'' (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake}),
\emph{etc.} In total, we obtain links to 20~English articles
about different types of natural disasters.%
\footnote{``Avalanche'', ``Blizzard'', ``Cyclone'', ``Drought'', ``Earthquake'',
``Epidemic'', ``Extratropical cyclone'', ``Flood'', ``Gamma-ray burst'', ``Hail'',
``Heat wave'', ``Impact event'', ``Limnic eruption'', ``Meteorological disaster'',
``Solar flare'', ``Tornado'', ``Tropical cyclone'', ``Tsunami'',
``Volcanic eruption'', ``Wildfire''}
For each of these English natural disasters articles,
we obtain all versions of each article in different languages
[step \emph{(i)} above],
and of the resulting list of international articles
in turn all their redirect URLs [step \emph{(ii)} above].
The intermediate result is a~complete list of all (currently~1,270) articles
in all Wikipedia languages and all their redirects
that have any type of natural disaster as their subject.
We call this list the ``natural disasters list''
and make it publicly available in different formats
(\texttt{.txt}, \texttt{.tsv}, and \texttt{.json}), where the JSON version
is the most flexible and recommended one.%
\footnote{``Natural disasters list'':
\url{https://github.com/tomayac/postdoc/blob/master/papers/comprehensive-wikipedia-monitoring-for-global-and-realtime-natural-disaster-detection/data/natural-disasters-list.json}}
Finally, we obtain for each of the 1,270~articles
in the ``natural disasters list''
all their back links, \emph{i.e.}, their inbound links
[step \emph{(iii)} above], which serves to detect
instances of natural disasters unknown at system creation time.
For example, the article ``Typhoon Rammasun (2014)''
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Rammasun_(2014)})---%
which, as a~concrete \emph{instance of} a~natural disaster
of type tropical cyclone, is \emph{not} contained in our
``natural disasters list''---links back to ``Tropical cyclone''
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone}),
so we can identify ``Typhoon Rammasun (2014)'' as \emph{related to}
tropical cyclones (but not necessarily \emph{identify as} a~tropical cyclone),
even if at the system's creation time the typhoon did not exist yet.
Analog to the inbound links, we obtain all
outbound links of all articles in the ``natural disasters list'',
\emph{e.g.}, ``Tropical cyclone'' has an outbound link to
``2014 Pacific typhoon season''
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Pacific_typhoon_season}),
which also happens to be an inbound link of ``Tropical cyclone'',
so we have detected a~mutual, circular link structure.
Figure~\ref{fig:link-structure} shows the example in its entirety,
starting from the seed level, to the disaster type level, to the in-/outbound link level.
The end result is a~large list called the ``monitoring list''
of all articles in all Wikipedia languages
that are somehow---via a~redirect, inbound, or outbound link (or resulting mutual link)---%
related to any of the articles
in the ``natural disasters list''.
We make a snapshot of this dynamic ``monitoring list'' available for reference,%
\footnote{``Monitoring list'':
\url{https://github.com/tomayac/postdoc/blob/master/papers/comprehensive-wikipedia-monitoring-for-global-and-realtime-natural-disaster-detection/data/monitoring-list.json}}
but note that it will be out-of-date soon and should be regenerated
on a~regular basis.
The current version holds 141,001 different articles.

\begin{figure*}[hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{link-structure}
  \caption{Extracted Wikipedia link structure starting from seed article ``Natural disaster''}
  \label{fig:link-structure}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Monitoring Process}
\label{sec:monitoring-process}

In the past, we have worked on a~Server-Sent Events (SSE) API%
~\cite{steiner2014bots} capable of monitoring realtime editing activity
on all language versions of Wikipedia.
This API allows us to easily analyze Wikipedia edits
by reacting on events fired by the API.
Whenever an edit event occurs, we check if it is for one of the articles
on our ``monitoring list''. 
We keep track of the historic one-day-window editing activity
for each article on the ``monitoring list'' including their versions in other languages,
and, upon a~sudden spike of editing activity,
trigger an alert about a~potential new instance of a~natural disaster type
that the spiking article is an inbound or outbound link of (or both).
To illustrate this, if, \emph{e.g.}, the German article
``Pazifische Taifunsaison 2014'' including all of its language links is spiking,
we can infer that this is related to a~natural disaster
of type ``Tropical cyclone'' due to the detected
mutual link structure mentioned earlier (Figure~\ref{fig:link-structure}).

In order to detect spikes, we apply exponential smoothing
to the last $n$ edit intervals (we require $n\geq5$) that occurred in the past 24 hours
with a~smoothing factor $\alpha = 0.5$.
The therefore required edit events are retrieved programmatically via the Wikipedia API.%
\footnote{Wikipedia last revisions:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvlimit=6&rvprop=timestamp|user&titles=Typhoon_Rammasun_(2014)}}
As a~spike occurs when an edit interval gets ``short enough''
compared to historic editing activity,
we report a~spike whenever the latest edit interval
is shorter than half a~standard deviation $0.5 \times \sigma$.

A~subset of all Wikipedia articles are geo-referenced,%
\footnote{Article geo coordinates:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=coordinates&format=json&colimit=max&coprop=dim|country|region|globe&coprimary=all&titles=September_11_attacks}}
so when we detect a~spiking article,
we try to obtain geo coordinates for the article itself
(\emph{e.g.}, ``Pazifische Taifunsaison 2014'')
or any of its language links
that---as a~consequence of the assumption in $\mathbb{H}2$---%
may provide more local details
(\emph{e.g.}, ``2014 Pacific typhoon season'' in English or
\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}``2014年太平洋颱風季''\end{CJK*} in Chinese).
We then calculate the center point of all obtained latitude/longitude pairs.

\subsection{Multimedia Content from Online Social Networking Sites}

In the past, we have worked on an application called
\emph{Social Media Illustrator}~\cite{steiner2013meteoroid,steiner2013tocrop}
that provides a~social multimedia search framework
that enables searching for and extraction of
multimedia data from the online social networking sites
Google\texttt{+},%
\footnote{Google\texttt{+}: \url{https://plus.google.com/}}
Facebook,\footnote{Facebook: \url{https://www.facebook.com/}}
Twitter,\footnote{Twitter: \url{https://twitter.com/}}
Instagram,\footnote{Instagram: \url{http://instagram.com/}}
YouTube,\footnote{YouTube: \url{http://www.youtube.com/}}
Flickr,\footnote{Flickr: \url{http://www.flickr.com/}}
MobyPicture,\footnote{MobyPicture: \url{http://www.mobypicture.com/}}
TwitPic,\footnote{TwitPic: \url{http://twitpic.com/}}
and Wikimedia Commons.%
\footnote{Wikimedia Commons: \url{http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page}}
In a~first step, it deduplicates exact- and near-duplicate
social multimedia data based on an algorithm described in%
~\cite{steiner2013clustering}.
It then ranks social multimedia data by social signals%
~\cite{steiner2013meteoroid} based on an abstraction layer
on top of the online social networking sites mentioned above
and, in a~final step, allows for the creation of media galleries
following aesthetic principles~\cite{steiner2012aesthetic}
of the two kinds \emph{Strict Order, Equal Size}
and \emph{Loose Order, Varying Size},
defined in~\cite{steiner2013tocrop}.
We have ported the crucial parts
of the source code of \emph{Social Media Illustrator}
from the client-side to the server-side,
enabling us now to create media galleries at scale and on demand,
based on the titles of spiking Wikipedia articles.
One exemplary media gallery can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot},
each individual media item in the gallery is clickable
and links back to the original post
on the particular online social networking site,
allowing crisis responders to monitor the media gallery as a~whole,
and to investigate interesting media items at the source.


\subsection{Linked Data Publication}

In a~final step, once a~given confidence threshold has been reached
and upon human inspection, we plan to send out a~notification
according to the \emph{Common Alerting Protocol}
following the format that (for GDACS) can be seen in Listing~\ref{listing:cap}.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

We have created a~publicly available prototypal demo application
deployed%
\footnote{Source code:
\url{https://github.com/tomayac/postdoc/tree/master/demos/disaster-monitor}}
at \url{http://disaster-monitor.herokuapp.com/}
that internally connects to the SSE API from~\cite{steiner2014bots}.
%located at \url{http://wikipedia-edits.herokuapp.com/sse}.
It is implemented in Node.js on the server,
and as a~JavaScript Web application on the client.
This application uses an hourly refreshed version of the ``monitoring list''
from Section~\ref{sec:identification-of-monitoring}
and whenever an edit event sent through the SSE API
matches any of the articles in the list,
it checks if, given this article's and its language links'
edit history of the past 24 hours,
the current edit event shows spiking behavior,
as outlined in Section~\ref{sec:monitoring-process}.
The core source code snippet of the main monitoring loop
can be seen in Section~\ref{listing:monitoring},
a~screenshot of the application is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Main monitoring loop of the natural disaster monitor},

var init = function() {

  // fired whenever an edit event happens on any Wikipedia
  var parseWikipediaEdit = function(data) {
    var article = data.language + ':' + data.article;
    var disasterObj = monitoringList[article];
    // the article is on the monitoring list
    if (disasterObj) {    
      showCandidateArticle(data.article, data.language, disasterObj);
    }
  };
  
  // fired whenever an article is on the monitoring list
  var showCandidateArticle = function(article, language, roles) {
    getGeoData(article, language, function(err, geoData) {
      getRevisionsData(article, language, function(err, revisionsData) {
        if (revisionsData.spiking) {
          // spiking article
        }
        if (geoData.averageCoordinates.lat) {
          // geo-referenced article, create map
        }
        // trigger alert if article is spiking
      });
    });
  };  

  getMonitoringList(seedArticle, function(err, data) {
    // get the initial monitoring list
    if (err) {
      return console.log('Error initializing the app.');
    }
    monitoringList = data;
    console.log('Monitoring ' + Object.keys(monitoringList).length +
        ' candidate Wikipedia articles.');
    
    // start monitoring process once we have a monitoring list
    var wikiSource = new EventSource(wikipediaEdits);
    wikiSource.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
      return parseWikipediaEdit(JSON.parse(e.data));
    });
    
    // auto-refresh monitoring list every hour
    setInterval(function() {
      getMonitoringList(seedArticle, function(err, data) {
        if (err) {
          return console.log('Error refreshing monitoring list.');
        }
        monitoringList = data;
        console.log('Monitoring ' + Object.keys(monitoringList).length +
            ' candidate Wikipedia articles.');
      });
    }, 1000 * 60 * 60);
  });
};
init();
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Proposed Steps Toward an Evaluation}

We recall our core research questions that were
$\mathbb{Q}1$ \emph{How timely and accurate for the purpose
of natural disaster detection is content from Wikipedia
compared to authoritative sources mentioned above?} and
$\mathbb{Q}2$ \emph{Does the disambiguated nature of Wikipedia
surpass keyword-based natural disaster detection approaches,
\emph{e.g.}, via online social networking sites or search logs?}
Regarding $\mathbb{Q}1$, only a~manual comparison
covering several months worth
of natural disaster data of the relevant authoritative data sources
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:natural-disaster-detection}
with the output of our system can help respond to the question.
Regarding $\mathbb{Q}2$, we propose an evaluation strategy
for the OSN site Twitter,
loosely inspired by the approach of Sakaki \emph{et~al.}\
in~\cite{sakaki2010earthquake}.
We choose Twitter as a~data source due to the publicly available user data
through its streaming APIs,%
\footnote{Twitter streaming APIs:
\url{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/public}}
which would be considerably harder, if not impossible, with other OSNs or search logs
due to privacy concerns and API limitations.
Based on the articles in the ``monitoring list'',
we put forward using article titles as search terms,
but without disambiguation hints in parentheses,
\emph{e.g.}, instead of the complete article title
``Typhoon Rammasun (2014)'', we suggest using ``Typhoon Rammasun'' alone.
We advise monitoring the sample stream%
\footnote{Twitter sample stream:
\url{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/sample}}
for the appearance of any of the search terms,
as the filtered stream%
\footnote{Twitter filtered stream:
\url{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/filter}}
is too limited regarding the number of supported search terms.
In order to avoid ambiguity issues with the
international multi-language tweet stream,
we recommend matching search terms only
if the Twitter-detected tweet language equals
the search term's language, \emph{e.g.}, English, as in ``Typhoon Rammasun''.


\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this paper, we have presented first steps of our ongoing research
on the creation of a~Wikipedia-based natural disaster monitoring system,
in particular, we have finished its underlying code scaffolding.
While the system itself already works, a~good chunk of work still lies ahead
with the fine-tuning of its parameters.
A~first examples are the exponential smoothing parameters
of the revision intervals, responsible for determining whether an article
is spiking, and thus a~potential new natural disaster, or not.
A~second example is the role that natural disasters play with articles:
they can be inbound, outbound, or mutual links,
and their importance for actual occurrences of disasters will vary.
Future work will mainly focus on finding answers to our research questions
$\mathbb{Q}1$ and $\mathbb{Q}2$ and the verification of the hypotheses
$\mathbb{H}1$--$\mathbb{H}3$.
We will focus on the evaluation of the system's usefulness, accuracy,
and timeliness in comparison to other keyword-based approaches.
An interesting aspect of our work is that the monitoring system
is not limited to natural disasters.
Using an analog approach, we can monitor for human-made disasters
(called ``Anthropogenic hazard'' on Wikipedia)
like terrorism, war, power outages, air disasters, \emph{etc.}
We have created an exemplary ``monitoring list'' and made it available.%
\footnote{Anthropogenic hazard ``monitoring list'':
\url{https://github.com/tomayac/postdoc/blob/master/papers/comprehensive-wikipedia-monitoring-for-global-and-realtime-natural-disaster-detection/data/monitoring-list-anthropogenic-hazard.json}}
Concluding, we are excited about this research
and look forward to putting the final system into operational practice.
